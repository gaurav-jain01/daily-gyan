                Apple Inc. is on the verge of opening its inaugural retail store in India, marking a significant milestone for the company as it invests heavily in the South Asian country's manufacturing and sales potential. The firm recently shared a photo of the barricade outside the store in Mumbai's financial district, but withheld the opening date.
